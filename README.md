# airplane-crash-analysis-eda-ml-project

## Exploring patterns in aviation accidents using EDA and machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

This project analyzes a dataset of airplane crashes to uncover trends, 
detect anomalies, and build predictive models for classification. 
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I identified 
potential outliers, selected the most relevant feature, and visualized key insights related to aviation 
accidents.

For the machine learning component, I implemented Logistic Regression, 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest to 
classify incidents based on available features. The goal is to compare 
model performance, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and 
determine the most effective classifier for this dataset.

This project is designed to highlight fundamental EDA principles and 
machine learning workflows, demonstrating my ability to analyze complex 
datasets, develop predictive models, and communicate findings effectively.

## How to install this project (In Development ðŸš€)

The easiest way is to watch my tutorial video (Coming Soon ðŸš€), but here's the short version
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
3. Install dependencies
4. Run jupyter notebook

##  Future improvements
1. Explore additional feature engineering techniques.
- NLP on summary column
- Multiclass Classification (Low Fatality, Medium Fatality, High Fatality)
2. Test alternative ML models for better classification performance.
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Multi--Layer Perception (MLP) using TensorFlow/Keras
3. Expand visualizations to better understand accident trends.
- Create an interactive crash location map
- Highlight hotspot regions
